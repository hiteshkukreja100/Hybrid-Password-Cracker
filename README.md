# Hybrid-Password-Cracker
A hybrid password cracker combines dictionary attacks with brute-force techniques to cover more potential password combinations. The idea is to use a list of common passwords (dictionary) and then extend these passwords with additional characters, such as numbers or special symbols. This approach increases the chances of cracking passwords that are slight variations of common passwords.

# Features of a Hybrid Password Cracker
## Dictionary-Based: Uses a dictionary of the 10,000 most common passwords to start with.

## Brute-Force Extension: Extends the dictionary words with additional characters (numbers, symbols, etc.) to create more potential passwords.

## Customizable Extensions: Allows the user to specify the characters and the maximum length for the extensions.

## Parallel Processing: Utilizes multiple processors to speed up the cracking process.

## Hash Comparison: Compares each generated passwordâ€™s hash with the target hash to find the correct password.
